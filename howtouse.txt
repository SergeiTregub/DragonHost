How to use?
===========

Welcome to python hosting project. Today it is called "DragonHost". Let's go!

You should have python installed and added to path if you use Windows.

Python preinstalled on some linux OS.


Running main.py will ask you to use main.sh, because hosting doesn't work from .py format.

Once hosting, type in browser "localhost:8080" if you don't know your IP. Then if it
redirects you to directory listing, just click on index.html and your website will
be shown.

Hopefully this project will help you!

If you want, you can modify..

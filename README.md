# DragonHost
Hosting local website. Using Python.

WARNING! DragonHost's goal is to reach 2.3 update. Once reached, DragonHost will move to new LOCAL website hosting provider. Also uses python. https://www.python.org/

# How to use
Host websites using python. Well main.py will ask you to use main.sh btw

# It works!
Try editing index.html

Works in linux only.
Clone using git or download zip.

# When there will be windows support?
It is here already. Just rename main.sh to main.bat format.
SLEEP COMMAND DOESN'T WORK ON WINDOWS! IT DOESN'T EXIST.

# It doesn't work..
Make sure you have python installed. If just "python" doesn't work, try using python 3.

# Instructions
Clone the repository or click on green "Code" button and click "Download ZIP".
Extract zip. Or open the folder if you cloned.

LINUX: Open terminal and go to location where DragonHost is. Then type "chmod +x main.sh" and "./main.sh". It will welcome you and hosting will start.

WINDOWS: Extract zip. Open it. Rename "main.sh" to "main.bat". Open "main.bat" and wait for hosting to start.

# I have problems! What to do?
Please open issues and publish your problem. We will view and ask you what to do.

# How do I view my local website?
Don't know your IP? Type "localhost:8080" in browser search bar. Doesn't work? Try "0.0.0.0:8080".

# Why the port is 8080?
Because for safety.
